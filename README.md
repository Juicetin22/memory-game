# Memory Games

Welcome! Memory Games is a react-based web application containing 3 simple card-flipping games that work your memory. Two of the card games may look familiar, but the third game is unique and something I came up with (it's nothing too crazy). Whether you're taking a break or want to just see what it's about, consider giving the games a try!
